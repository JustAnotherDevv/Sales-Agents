## Agent Communication Flow

1. Company submits sales specification via CLI
2. Scraper Agent (1): Retrieves potential leads from mock data
3. Alignment Agent (2): Uses ASI-1 Mini to match leads with company's sales spec
4. Scoring Agent (3): Uses ASI-1 Mini to score and price leads
5. Summary Agent (4): Uses ASI-1 Mini to generate intelligent summaries
6. Company views and purchases leads via CLI
7. Mock blockchain transaction reveals full lead details

## Key Components

- **Company CLI**: Interface for companies to submit specs and view leads
- **Scraper Agent**: Retrieves potential leads (mocked for demo)
- **Alignment Agent**: Matches leads with company requirements using ASI-1 Mini
- **Scoring Agent**: Scores and prices leads using ASI-1 Mini
- **Summary Agent**: Generates intelligent summaries using ASI-1 Mini
- **Mock Services**:
  - Self Authentication: User management and auth
  - Walrus Storage: Local JSON storage
  - OG Network: Mock blockchain transactions
- **Agent Registration**: Simulates registration on ASI:One and Agentverse.ai

## ASI-1 Mini Integration Points

1. **Alignment Agent**: Intent matching, keyword extraction
2. **Scoring Agent**: Multi-factor lead evaluation
3. **Summary Agent**: Context-aware summarization, knowledge graph connections

## Data Flow

- Sales Spec → Scraper → Alignment → Scoring → Summary → Company
- Lead Data: Progressively enriched through the agent pipeline
- Payment Flow: Company → Mock Blockchain → Lead Contact Reveal
