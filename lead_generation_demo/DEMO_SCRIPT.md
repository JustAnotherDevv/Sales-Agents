## Key Demonstration Points

1. **Agent Registration:** All agents register with ASI:One and Agentverse.ai
2. **Agent Communication:** Asynchronous message passing between agents
3. **ASI-1 Mini Integration:** Three integration points showcasing different capabilities:
   - Intent matching in Alignment Agent
   - Multi-factor scoring in Scoring Agent
   - Context-aware summarization in Summary Agent
4. **Mock Services:** Authentication, storage, and blockchain transactions
5. **Logging:** Detailed logging showing agent interactions and data flow

## Troubleshooting

- If agents fail to communicate, ensure all are running and check port configurations
- If CLI crashes, restart it and authenticate again
- If no leads appear, try a different sales specification with broader keywords
